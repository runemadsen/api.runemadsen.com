api.runemadsen.com
==================

This is the codebase for `api.runemadsen.com`, which is a hypermedia API with data around me, Rune Madsen. In a hypermedia'ish way, the API is explanatory. Do a `GET` on `api.runemadsen.com`, and it will list all resources available for unauthenticated users. If you have an authentication token (which you don't, because there's only one for me), it will also list requests you can make while authenticated.
